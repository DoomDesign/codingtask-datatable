# Coding Task: Data Table

A coding task solution.
See [EXPLANATION.md](EXPLANATION.md) for how I implemented the given requirements.

## How to: Run the application

- Clone this repo
- Run `npm install` in the projects root directory
- Install [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) (version 16.2.12) globally
- Either start a development server or build the application, following the instructions below:

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
